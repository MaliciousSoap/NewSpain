My unity Game


This is a project, I'll be working on over thanksgiving break. If you have any suggestions to my code... Feel free to do so-- Although I don't check github that often, any help
would never be unnapreciated.


if you find any code you'd like to take, then I'd be honored to have contributed to someone's project.



The game I'm working on is on the premise of Colonial nations like spain and portugal vying for world domination. 

I'm planning on adding all things about war, government, economy and colonization. I'll be satisfied when I've implemented an age system on the Rise of the iberian peninsula, The decline of the iberian peninsula, The rivarly of the english channel, The Imperialism Free for all with the Victor in all these ages being given the title, ruler of the waves and the ending being a final title card about the decline of the west and maybe a little footnote about the Winning country's future citizens still wishing they were the rulers of the waves.
