This is a project, I'll be working on over Winter break. If you have any suggestions to my code... Feel free to do so-- Although I don't check github that often, any help
would never be unnapreciated. This is more for me, like trello but with the added bonus of version control, It's public because if the day comes that I forget everything -- including my passwords-- atleast I'll be able to keep this.




The game I'm working on is on the premise of Colonial nations like spain and portugal vying for world domination. 



I'm planning on adding all things about war, government, economy and colonization. I'll be satisfied when I've implemented an age system on the Rise of the iberian peninsula, The decline of the iberian peninsula, The rivarly of the english channel, The Imperialism Free for all with the Victor in all these ages being given the title, ruler of the waves and the ending being a final title card about the decline of the west and maybe a little footnote about the Winning country's future citizens still wishing they were the rulers of the waves.
